    "text": "number of fields that need a ton or half a ton, right? Yes. One question I had for you is what is your pH target? Where do you want your pHs to be? We're doing potatoes, so we want to be 6.2, 6.3, anywhere from 6 to 6.5 is our target. Okay, got it. And are you worried about going higher at all or is that... Well, it is not so much. You know, we don't want to be, you know, 7 runs up a red flag. Okay. You don't want to be at 7 is what you're saying? No, we don't want to be 7 or above. Not to say that we don't have some spots that are, but... And why is that? Are you worried about manganese or like what's the... Why are you worried about going to 7? That is on tobacco, you know, that is always been, you know, you get a better... It takes up the... When you get to that point, it seems like you lose part of your fertilization program. Yep, yep. But you still have tobacco fields or...? Yeah, we still got some, but you know, most of those have been, you know, put lime on them already. Okay, got it, got it. The fields that... And I don't know if you noticed off the top of your head, but the fields that Mary had shared with me are the Green Pond CMC, Green Pond Loop and Bailey HQ. You know what's going on these fields this year? Yeah, sweet potatoes. On all of them? On the ones you just called over, the Bailey headquarters and... Green Pond Loop and Green Pond CMC? Yes, yes. Okay. Well, no, the Green Pond, the big field at Green Pond has had lime on it for... Because it's going to put tobacco in it. Because it's done last week. Oh, so you already put lime on those? Oh, yes, on that one field there. Okay, got it. On the bigger one? Yes, yes, sir. Okay, got it. That's like the 55, 60 acres, that field? That's correct, yes. Right, okay, got it. So let me write that down. So Green Pond CMC has already put lime. Okay, got it. For the Bailey field, let me... Are you good with email communication? Is that good if I send you something over email and what our recommendations for those fields would be? Yes, that's fine. Okay, okay, excellent. So yeah, let me send that over to you for the Bailey field and then for the smaller Green Pond field as well. Okay. What's going on to the smaller Green Pond field? They're basically putting the taro on. Okay, got it, got it. And so are you tilling those fields at all? Yes, we will be. Yep, yep, okay, perfect. And then when is your ideal timing? Like when do you want to put the... When would you like? Yeah, I would like to go on and get it on now. Okay. Let it be working, let it be breaking down. Yep, yep. So as soon as possible. When are you planting the sweet potatoes? The sweet potatoes are going to go on there in late April. And then we got to gas the land, so we got to be three weeks, two to, let's say two weeks ahead of the end of the plant. Okay, got it. That's the reason we went on with this tobacco because, on the line, because we don't have that window to wait to the day that we're ready to plant. Yep, yep. Okay."
